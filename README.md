# ML-Linkedin_User_Classification
The client, WeCloudData, is the leading data science education and career service provider in Canada. The client has collected the alumni and student profiles from Linkedin. This project is to, through analyzing the corresponding profiles, examine the partnerships/connections between the school and its alumni, which is critical to the schoolâ€™s business developments. This project is the development of a machine learning model used to track the employment status of recent graduates. The suggested approach by the client is to identify the presence of the green 'open-to-work' frame on the Linkedin profile images.
